      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        The first website I ever tried to make was in 2019 for a videogame I played. I didn't know anything about code so I tried learning Wordpress to build the site. I wasn't able to finish building the site but through the process, I realized that this was something I enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then I have learned much more than Wordpress and my passion for this field is just as high as it was the day I centered my first div. I have used these skills that I have acquired to contribute to my personal projects, excel in my classes and even contribute to a startup. I hope to be able to use and continue to improve my skills in future endeavors!
