      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Kadeem and I really enjoy making websites. The first
        website I ever tried to make was in 2019 for a videogame I played. I
        didn't know anything about code so I tried learning Wordpress to build
        the site. I wasn't able to finish building the site but through the
        process, I realized that this was something I enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then I have learned much more than Wordpress and my passionate for
        this field is just as high as it was the day I centered my first div. I
        have used these skills that I have acquired to contribute to my personal
        projects, excel in my classes and even contribute to a startup. I hope
        to be able to use and continue to improve my skills in future endeavors!
      </p>
